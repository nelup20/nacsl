# NACSL - Nelu's Awful C Standard Library
NACSL is a library which aims to provide generic & easy-to-use abstractions (largely inspired by Java's stdlib) for C projects with a great emphasis on readability.
This is a toy project which I wanted to create in order to learn C better, and to have a library that I know inside and out for future C projects.

Although I won't completely neglect things like performance & security, it's safe to assume there are many vulnerabilities present, and performance won't be great. 
Again, readability & ease of use are the top priorities.

To say "using this in production is absolutely insane" would be putting it lightly. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

# I'm new to C, how do I use this?
